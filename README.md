# Iris-Data-Logistic-Reg

Fitting the logistic regression to the iris dataset. Here we have four independent explanatory variables and one dependent variables. Since we know that if there exist multicolinearity abong the predictoprs then we face some sort of difficulties. In this project I tried to see if there is any performance drop if some of the explanatory variables are correlated. To make the explanatory variables uncorrelated I applied PCA to the explanatory variables.
